Type 1 : Installed on bare metal as OS (e.g ESXI vSphere, Citrix XEN, KVM , Miscrosoft Hyper-V)
         Generally in data centers use this.
Type 2 : Install on top of Host OS as softwares
       	 it can be linux or windows host.
         e.g vmware fusion, Oracle virtual box,  paralles 
virtualized networking :
Your physical NIC needs be mapped or shared across multiple VMs to make VM's talk to out side world.
How to acheive that ?.
Typically , on Hypervisor, we create Open vSwitch. In this vSwitch we map veth from
VM into a physical NIC with vlan. Thus a single physical NIC can be mapped  used by multiple
VM's with vlan as seperator, and without VM's knowing that what is the other VM using this physical NIC.

How VM's to VM communicate?.
Veths if they are in different network, create vRouter, adn add veths into that vRouter to route
these networks.

Virtulization Use Cases.
Server virtualization:
e.g Migrate single purpose hosts(e.g dhcp server, dns server etc etc, db server) to VM.
    Then host VM via Hypervisor on a single baremetal server.


VDI: Virtual Desktop Infra:
How user client machine on a VM.(think clients, because they have bare minimal OS infra), no info
is stored on the thin-clients. Secure,
