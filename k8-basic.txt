What is a Kubernetes pod?.
Its a Group of containers.
That's correct. In Kubernetes, a group of one or more containers is called a pod. Containers in a pod are deployed together. They are started, stopped, and replicated as a group.

The simplest workload that Kubernetes can deploy is a pod that consists only of a single container.


What is a Kubernetes cluster?
Its a Group of machines where Kubernetes can schedule workloads.
A Kubernetes cluster is a group of machines where Kubernetes can schedule containers in pods. The machines in the cluster are called “nodes.”
